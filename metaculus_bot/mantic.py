"""Client for Mantic's competitions platform (competitions.mantic.com).

Mantic's "Crucible" tournaments run on a fork of the open-source Metaculus platform, so the
framework's ``MetaculusClient`` is the transport (same endpoints, same ``Token`` auth, same post
JSON) and the repo's class-level fetch and publish hardening apply to this subclass unchanged: it
overrides none of ``_get_questions_from_api``, ``_post_question_prediction`` or
``post_question_comment``. Three differences, verified against the live API on 2026-09-08, need code:

1. The list filter ``forecast_type`` speaks ``quantitative`` where the framework sends
   ``numeric,discrete``, so the framework's default tournament fetch returns ZERO quantitative
   questions. The fetch here omits the parameter (``ApiFilter(allowed_types=[])``) and leaves type
   filtering to the bot's own guard in ``forecaster.forecast_questions``.
2. Series 2 questions may arrive as ``question.type == "quantitative"`` (Mantic merged numeric and
   discrete). forecasting-tools 0.2.92 raises ``ValueError`` on it and ``_get_questions_from_api``
   swallows that as a warning, so the post would be silently dropped. The type is rewritten to
   ``discrete`` before parsing; the ``scaling`` semantics (bins, ``inbound_outcome_count``,
   ``zero_point``) are identical.
3. The framework hardcodes ``https://www.metaculus.com/questions/{post_id}`` as ``page_url``.

Three robustness rules from the 2026-09-08 readiness review sit beside them:

- The tournament fetch asks for a CEILING of questions (``MANTIC_FETCH_QUESTION_CEILING``) rather
  than the framework's default single page of 100, because Mantic's paginator advertises a ``next``
  link past the last page (offset 600 of a 520-post tournament still carries one), so only walking
  offsets until an empty page can prove there is nothing more.
- A post the framework cannot parse used to be forfeited silently: ``_get_questions_from_api`` logs
  one warning per failed post and continues, nothing counts it, and after the 90-day log expiry it
  is gone. The parse override now counts the drop (``get_post_drop_count``, read into cli's
  alertable arithmetic so the run reddens) and emits one ``MANTIC_POST_DROPPED`` line before
  re-raising. Fail-fast is kept: nothing here swallows the error.
- :func:`preflight_mantic_tournaments` makes two authenticated GETs before any spend, neither
  retried. The tournament list logs ``MANTIC_TOURNAMENTS`` naming every ongoing bots-only tournament,
  at WARNING when one is not the configured slug, so a Series 2 slug is named in the log the run it
  appears. The configured tournament's own route (``/projects/tournaments/<slug>/``) is then read
  and the run refuses to proceed unless the token's ``user_permission`` there allows forecasting (a
  view-only token reads fine and would fail only at the publish POST, after the ensemble had been
  paid for, every hour). The detail route rather than the list row because the list omits an
  ``unlisted`` project, the state a new season sits in before its first question opens, so absence
  from the list proves nothing, while a slug no tournament has 404s there. Every failure shape of
  either GET is one ``ApiIdentityError`` for the operator to grep.

Every parsed question emits one ``MANTIC_QUESTION`` line so the fields Mantic added and the framework
does not model (``multi_resolution``, ``date_granularity``, ``precision``), plus the type as it
arrived on the wire, outlive the 90-day GitHub Actions log expiry for residual analysis. The specs
live in ``scripts/telemetry/markers.py``; the verbatim example lines in
``tests/test_telemetry_markers.py``.

Conditional posts are not modelled: Mantic publishes none, and the bot's type guard drops
``ConditionalQuestion`` anyway, so one reaching this client is counted and logged as a dropped post
and surfaces as the framework's per-post "Error processing post" warning rather than as a forecast.

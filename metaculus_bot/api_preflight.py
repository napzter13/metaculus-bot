"""One-shot identity check for a question platform's API host, run before we send the token.

On 2026-07-21 metaculus.com's DNS was repointed at a GoDaddy parking host (WHOIS
updated that day, GoDaddy nameservers serving parking IPs, a fresh GoDaddy DV
cert for www.metaculus.com issued the same afternoon). The bot's scheduled
GitHub Actions runs kept firing and forecasting-tools attached
``Authorization: Token $METACULUS_TOKEN`` to the question-fetch GET
(``forecasting_tools/helpers/metaculus_api.py`` line 409:
``requests.get(url, params=params, **cls._get_auth_headers())``), leaking the
token to an unknown host before dying on an opaque 404. The real Metaculus
origin was still alive behind Cloudflare — this was an upstream domain incident,
not a code bug.

``verify_api_identity`` makes ONE unauthenticated request (no token, no headers)
to the posts list under the given API base URL and confirms the host behaves
like the real API before any authenticated call runs. ``verify_metaculus_api_identity``
is the Metaculus run modes' wrapper over it; the Mantic run mode calls
``verify_api_identity`` with ``MANTIC_API_BASE_URL`` directly, so a Mantic run
never depends on Metaculus DNS health. Two jobs:

1. Never send the token to a host we haven't sanity-checked — the preflight
   itself carries no credentials.
2. Fail fast with a diagnostic that names the vetted host and the likely cause
   (DNS parking/hijack), instead of a bare ``HTTPError`` traceback from deep
   inside forecasting-tools.

The request goes through an isolated ``requests.Session`` with
``trust_env=False``. That is load-bearing, not hygiene: with the default
``trust_env=True``, ``Session.prepare_request`` calls ``get_netrc_auth(url)``
and a matching ``machine www.metaculus.com`` — or a generic ``default`` — entry
in ``~/.netrc`` / ``$NETRC`` would attach ``Authorization: Basic ...`` to this
"unauthenticated" probe (reproduced live on requests 2.34.2), defeating the
whole point on exactly the hijack path this guard exists to cover. Disabling
``trust_env`` also skips proxy-env and ``REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`` pickup for this
one call; that is an accepted trade — GHA runners have direct egress, and the
no-credentials-to-an-unknown-host invariant wins over honoring ambient network
config for a single identity probe.

Deliberately NOT retried: this is an identity gate, not a transient-failure
absorber. Retries (with the token attached) belong to ``fetch_hardening``, which
runs only after identity is established. One shot, fail fast.

One failure class is SKIPPED rather than failed: nothing reachable at all (DNS, connect, reset or
timeout; ``TransientNetworkError``). No host answered this probe, which carries no credential, and
no identity was contradicted, so the entry point ends the run with exit 0 and a
``TRANSIENT_NETWORK_SKIP`` marker and the next slot simply tries again (2026-10-02: a WAN reconnect
broke DNS for one slot and failed the run). The same classification covers the later authenticated
requests, and there "skipped" is weaker than "nothing sent": they go only to the host this probe
vetted, over verified TLS, so a timeout can follow a request that host received, token included. That
is no leak, but it is not silence either. A TLS failure and a wrong answer stay hard failures: a host
that answered wrongly is the case this gate exists for.

Signatures observed live:

- Metaculus, unauthenticated GET ``/api/posts/?limit=1`` -> 403, ``text/plain``
  body "Permission Error: The API is only available to authenticated users."
  (2026-07-21).
- Metaculus, authenticated -> 200 JSON dict with a ``"results"`` key (2026-07-21).
- Mantic (``competitions.mantic.com/api``), unauthenticated GET ``/posts/?limit=1``
  -> 200 ``application/json`` dict with a ``"results"`` key: its posts list is
  public and there is no Cloudflare in front (2026-09-08).
- Parked/hijacked host, same URL -> 404 empty body; ``/api2/...`` paths return
  200 with an HTML lander redirect (2026-07-21).

    cheap and side-effect-free apart from a missing-token warning, and it resolves

"""Download GHA run-log artifacts and harvest telemetry markers into a durable archive.

All six bot workflows tee stdout+stderr to ``run_logs/`` and upload it:

* every one of them (the four PROD workflows tournament / metaculus_cup / minibench / mantic,
  plus ``test_bot`` and ``test_bot_basic``) bundles ``run_logs/`` INSIDE the
  ``research-<run_id>`` artifact, alongside ``research_outputs/``;
* the two test workflows uploaded a SEPARATE ``logs-<run_id>`` artifact until 2026-08-03,
  and those stay on GHA until their 90-day retention expires.

So harvesting run logs means pulling BOTH artifact families and reading the ``*.log``
files under ``run_logs/``. Enumeration + download run through the shared
``scripts.gha_artifacts`` core (paginated, no-cap artifact enumeration): enumerate every
live artifact, filter to the two prefixes, download each, parse the logs via
:mod:`scripts.telemetry.markers`, and merge into ``backtests/telemetry_archive/``
(replace-by-run, idempotent).

WHY THIS MUST RUN REGULARLY: GHA deletes artifacts after 90 days (``retention-days: 90``
on every upload step). The local telemetry archive is the only durable copy of the
run-log markers — the same silent-loss risk that motivates the research-archive sync.
Read-only + free (GitHub API only); no paid LLM/research calls, no publishing.

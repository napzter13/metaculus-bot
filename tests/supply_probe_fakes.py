"""Dict builders shaped like the Metaculus posts-list payload, shared by the supply-probe tests.

A single-question post carries ``question``, a group post carries ``group_of_questions.questions``,
a notebook-shaped post carries neither, and every question carries ``scheduled_resolve_time`` /
``actual_resolve_time`` / ``resolution`` plus its open and close times. ``tests/test_supply_probe.py``
(the Metaculus mode) and ``tests/test_supply_probe_mantic.py`` (the Mantic mode, which adds the
public spot-time snapshot on top of this shape) both build from here so the two files cannot drift
into disagreeing about one payload.

Not named ``test_*`` on purpose: pytest imports it without collecting it. Nothing here opens a socket.
